Firsly, I would like to mention my colleagues Rynaldi Mauren and Anil Totakura. Together we completed this project.
In this project, a Two wheeled Robot is controlled with Arduino. 
State Machine is implemented for the drive of the robot and one more state machine is prepared for the Bluetooth On/Off.
This was developed as a concept of autonomous Mobile Robot. The written code can further be developed according to one's needs.
